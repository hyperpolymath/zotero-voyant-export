Preamble

The Palimpsest License is designed for works that embrace the collaborative,
iterative nature of knowledge creation. Like a palimpsest—a manuscript that
has been written over one or more times, with the earlier writing still
visible—this license acknowledges that creative works are built upon layers
of prior knowledge, effort, and contribution.

This license emphasizes:
- Attribution and acknowledgment of contributors
- Collaborative stewardship over individual ownership
- Transparency in modifications and derivations
- Solidarity economics and ethical use
- Preservation of attribution chains

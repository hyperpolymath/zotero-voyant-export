# Zotero Voyant Export

# This file indicates that certain operations require explicit user consent
# Reference: HTTP 430 status code proposal for consent-required operations

## Data Collection

This software does NOT collect any data automatically.

All exports are:
- User-initiated (explicit action required)
- Local-only (no network transmission)
- Fully controlled by the user

## User Consent Points

The following operations require explicit user action:

1. **Export Collection**
   - Requires: Right-click menu selection
   - User confirms: File save dialog
   - Consent type: Explicit action
   - Data scope: Selected collection only

2. **File Creation**
   - Requires: User selects save location via file picker
   - User confirms: Save button in dialog
   - Consent type: Explicit save action
   - Data scope: Exported ZIP file only

## No Consent Required For

- Reading Zotero database (read-only, local access)
- Plugin installation (user-initiated)
- Viewing debug output (user-initiated)

## Consent Withdrawal

Users may withdraw consent at any time by:
- Canceling export operation (close save dialog)
- Deleting exported files
- Uninstalling plugin (Tools → Add-ons → Remove)

## Privacy Principles

- **Offline-First**: No network calls, all processing local
- **User Control**: All actions require explicit user initiation
- **No Tracking**: No analytics, no telemetry, no phone-home
- **No Auto-Save**: User must explicitly choose save location
- **Transparency**: All operations logged in Zotero debug output

## Data Minimization

Exported data includes only:
- Bibliographic metadata (from Zotero)
- Attachment files (from Zotero)
- Generated metadata (MODS, Dublin Core)

No additional data collected, transmitted, or stored.

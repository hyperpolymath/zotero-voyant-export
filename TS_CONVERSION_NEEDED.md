# TypeScript/JavaScript → ReScript Conversion (Partial)

This repo has some ReScript but still contains TS/JS that needs conversion.

## Remaining Work
1. Find all `.ts`/`.tsx`/`.js`/`.jsx` files (excluding `.res.js`)
2. Create ReScript equivalents
3. Migrate logic and update imports
4. Delete original TS/JS files

## Policy
- No NEW TypeScript/JavaScript allowed
- CI will block new TS/JS files
- Existing TS/JS should be migrated over time

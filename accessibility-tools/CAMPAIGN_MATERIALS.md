### Template 1: Outreach to Internet Society (ISOC)

**Subject:** Partnership Proposal: Digital Accessibility Initiative

Dear [Name],

I am writing on behalf of [Organization/NUJ] to propose a partnership on a critical digital rights issue: web accessibility.

**The Problem:**
According to WebAIM's 2024 analysis, 96% of the top million websites have accessibility problems. This denies people with disabilities access to vital information needed for decisions about their lives - including journalism, healthcare, education, and civic participation.

**Our Solution:**
We've developed a comprehensive technical platform inspired by successful movements like HTTPS Everywhere and Let's Encrypt:

1. **Browser Extension** - Shows real-time accessibility scores (like HTTPS Everywhere drove HTTPS adoption)
2. **Testing Dashboard** - Public scoring of websites (like securityheaders.com)
3. **Monitoring API** - Continuous compliance tracking (like report-uri.com)
4. **Proposed Standards** - Easy-to-implement protocols (Accessibility-Policy headers, /.well-known/accessibility)
5. **Adoption Tracking** - Metrics across top 1M sites

**Why Internet Society?**
- Your mission of "Internet for Everyone" aligns perfectly
- Your convening power with technical community
- Your expertise in Internet governance and standards
- Your global reach through chapters

**What We're Asking:**
1. Partnership on developing and promoting the proposed standards
2. Help convening stakeholders (W3C, browser vendors, CDN providers)
3. Support in engaging search engines on ranking integration
4. Platform for presenting at ISOC events/working groups

**Impact:**
Like SSL/TLS went from <50% to >95% adoption through tools + standards + pressure, we believe accessibility can follow the same path.

All tools are open source (GPL-3.0). All data will be open. All standards will be free to implement.

Would you be available for a call to discuss this further?

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Organization]

### Template 2: Outreach to Search Engines

**Subject:** Proposal: Accessibility as Search Ranking Factor

Dear [Google/Bing/DuckDuckGo] Search Team,

I'm writing to propose integrating web accessibility as a ranking signal in your search algorithm.

**The Business Case:**

1. **Quality Signal**
   - Accessible sites correlate with better UX, mobile experience, and technical quality
   - 96% of top sites have accessibility issues - differentiator for quality results
   - Reduces spam/low-effort sites (they rarely invest in accessibility)

2. **User Value**
   - 1.3 billion people globally have disabilities (16% of population)
   - Aging populations means growing accessibility needs
   - Everyone benefits from accessible design (mobile users, low bandwidth, etc.)

3. **Regulatory Alignment**
   - EU Accessibility Act coming 2025
   - ADA digital requirements in US
   - Similar laws globally
   - Helping sites comply = helping users avoid legal sites

4. **Competitive Advantage**
   - First mover advantage in accessibility
   - Positive PR and brand alignment
   - Demonstrates commitment beyond profit

**Our Contribution:**

We've built the infrastructure to make this feasible:

1. **Standardized Signals** - Accessibility-Policy headers, /.well-known/accessibility
2. **Verification System** - Automated + manual testing for badge program
3. **Public Data** - Adoption metrics across top 1M sites
4. **Ecosystem Tools** - Extension, API, GitHub Actions for widespread adoption

**Phased Implementation:**

**Phase 1: Experiment (Months 1-6)**
- Test accessibility as ranking signal in limited sample
- Measure impact on user satisfaction metrics
- A/B test different weightings

**Phase 2: Incentivize (Months 7-12)**
- Rich snippets for verified accessible sites
- Badge display in search results
- "Accessibility: Verified" indicator

**Phase 3: Ranking Factor (Months 13-18)**
- Gradual rollout as ranking signal
- Public announcement to drive adoption
- Partnership with our tools/standards

**Similar Precedents:**
- HTTPS as ranking factor (2014) - drove 95%+ adoption
- Mobile-friendliness (2015) - drove responsive design
- Core Web Vitals (2021) - drove performance improvements

**Next Steps:**

We'd welcome the opportunity to:
1. Present detailed proposal
2. Share our technical infrastructure
3. Discuss pilot program
4. Collaborate on implementation

Would you be open to a meeting to discuss further?

Attached: Technical specification, adoption data, research summary

Best regards,

### Template 3: Media Pitch (for NUJ members)

**Subject:** Story Pitch: The 96% Problem - Web Accessibility Crisis

Dear [Editor/Producer],

**The Story:**
96% of the world's top websites are inaccessible to people with disabilities, denying access to vital information. But a grassroots tech movement is trying to change that - by following the playbook that made the web secure.

**Why Now:**
- WebAIM just released 2024 data showing the problem is getting worse, not better
- EU Accessibility Act takes effect June 2025
- New tools (modeled on HTTPS Everywhere) are launching to drive change
- Search engines are being lobbied to make accessibility a ranking factor

**The Angles:**

1. **Human Impact**
   - Interview people with disabilities unable to access news, healthcare info, job postings
   - Real stories of information denial

2. **Technical Solution**
   - How a browser extension and testing tools could drive change
   - Parallels to HTTPS adoption (went from <50% to >95% in a decade)

3. **Corporate Accountability**
   - Public scoreboard naming and shaming major sites
   - Why tech companies haven't fixed this despite decades of standards

4. **Advocacy Angle**
   - NUJ pushing for accessible journalism
   - Union/worker perspective on digital rights
   - Collective action model

**I Can Provide:**
- Interviews with developers, advocates, users
- Data visualization of the problem
- Demos of the tools
- Exclusive early access to scoreboard

**Similar Coverage:**
- The Guardian's HTTPS rollout story
- WIRED on Let's Encrypt
- Ars Technica on browser security features

Interested? Happy to discuss further or send more details.

Best,
[Your Name]

## 📢 Press Release Template

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**New Initiative Aims to Make Web Accessibility Universal Using HTTPS Playbook**

*Open-source tools, proposed standards, and search engine lobbying target 96% problem*

[CITY, DATE] - A new initiative launched today aims to make web accessibility universal by following the proven playbook that made HTTPS nearly universal: user-facing tools, free infrastructure, and search engine ranking pressure.

According to WebAIM's 2024 analysis, 96% of the top million websites have accessibility problems, denying people with disabilities access to vital information including journalism, healthcare, education, and employment.

"HTTPS went from less than 50% adoption to more than 95% in a decade," said [Name], [Title]. "It happened through browser extensions like HTTPS Everywhere, free infrastructure like Let's Encrypt, and Google making it a ranking factor. We're following the exact same playbook for accessibility."

The initiative includes:

- **Browser Extension**: Shows real-time accessibility scores for every website
- **Testing Dashboard**: Public scoreboard of websites (like securityheaders.com)
- **Monitoring API**: Continuous compliance tracking (like report-uri.com)
- **Proposed Standards**: Easy-to-implement Accessibility-Policy headers
- **Developer Tools**: GitHub Actions and CI/CD integration

All code is open source (GPL-3.0) and available at [link].

The initiative is seeking partnerships with Internet Society, W3C, browser vendors, and search engines. A formal proposal asking Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo to make accessibility a ranking factor will be submitted next month.

"Search engines made HTTPS a ranking factor and the web became secure," said [Name]. "If they do the same for accessibility, the web will become accessible. It's that simple."
